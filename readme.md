# Toy cautious doodle

Toy cautious doodle is a kind of assistant tool that can help you manage your daily tasks.

What's more, the tool is aimed at helping persist with something, carry on plans, head to dreams.

At the very first beginning, this program could be used to put task lists and diaries. In the future, however, it might be taken as the sign in module for coolerword or anything needs.

This php program is based on framework **Laravel 5.1 LTS**. To get more information or help, including how to install it, visit

As a matter of fact, this is the program I use to study Laravel framework.
